# SAS GTL
The goal of this study is to provide a basic understanding of building graphs templates using the Graph Template Language (GTL), a branch of the Output Delivery System (ODS). The paper starts with a simple example of a scatter plot to discuss the basic syntax of GTL and PROC SGRENDER, which is defined to identify an appropriate data set and template in “rendering” a plot. Gradually, the paper moves into discussing generating sophisticated graphics that are not offered directly by the Statistical Graphics (SG) procedure.
